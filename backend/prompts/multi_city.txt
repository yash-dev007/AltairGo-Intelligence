ADDITIONAL RULES FOR MULTI-CITY TRIPS (3+ cities):

ROUTING LOGIC:
- Order cities to create a logical geographic circuit (minimize backtracking)
- Consider: start near the international airport, end near departure point
- Classic patterns: Golden Triangle (Delhi → Agra → Jaipur → Delhi), coastal loop, mountain to beach
- Account for 1 full travel day when moving between cities > 200km apart

CITY TRANSITIONS:
- Dedicate a specific "travel_between_cities" entry for EVERY city change
- Compare all modes: Train vs. Flight vs. Bus (cost, duration, comfort)
- Overnight trains are budget-friendly (save hotel cost); recommend when journey is 5-8 hours
- For flights: factor in airport transfer time (usually adds 2-3 hours total)

PACING:
- Minimum 2 full days per city to explore meaningfully
- Avoid 1-day city hops unless cities are very close (< 1 hour travel)
- Plan "acclimatization" activity first thing in each new city (walk the neighborhood, hire local guide)

ACCOMMODATION STRATEGY:
- Stay centrally in each city (near railway station or main attractions)
- Same hotel both nights in a city avoids pack/unpack hassle — mention this benefit
- For a long trip, suggest 1-2 nights at a unique property (houseboat, heritage haveli, treehouse)

BUDGET ALLOCATION FOR MULTI-CITY:
- Transport budget increases to 25-30% (more intercity travel)
- Reduce activity budget slightly to 12-15% to compensate
- Factor in luggarge storage costs, porter fees at stations
