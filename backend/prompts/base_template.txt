=== DESTINATION KNOWLEDGE ===
{DESTINATION_DATA}

=== USER REQUIREMENTS ===
Starting from: {origin}

Specific destinations/regions chosen: {destinations}

=== CRITICAL RULES ===

BUDGET ACCURACY:
1. Total cost MUST be within ₹{budget} ± 5%
2. Cost distribution:
   - Transport: 20% of budget
   - Accommodation: 35% of budget
   - Food: 25% of budget
   - Activities: 15% of budget
   - Miscellaneous: 5% of budget
3. Style multipliers: budget=0.7x, standard=1.0x, luxury=1.5x

REALISTIC TIMING:
1. Maximum 4 major activities per day
2. Leave 30-minute buffer between activities
3. Travel time: same area=15-20 min, across city=45-60 min
4. Structure: Morning (9AM-12PM), Lunch (12PM-2PM), Afternoon (2PM-6PM), Evening (7PM-10PM)

SPECIFIC & ACCURATE DETAILS:
1. Use ONLY real, named places — never "local market" or "city center"
2. Exact costs in ₹ — not ranges
3. Include how to reach each place (transport mode + time + cost)
4. Specific restaurant names, not just "local food"

LOGICAL ROUTING:
1. Group geographically close attractions on same day
2. Minimize backtracking; avoid rush hours (8-10AM, 6-8PM) for cross-city travel
3. Order multi-city visits to minimize total travel distance
