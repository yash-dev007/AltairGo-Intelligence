          <p>Palawan is often cited as the most beautiful island in the world, and for good reason. While the Underground River in Puerto Princesa and the lagoons of El Nido get all the fame, there are still corners of this paradise that remain relatively untouched.</p>
          <h3>Balabac: The Last Frontier</h3>
          <p>Located at the southernmost tip of Palawan, Balabac is a cluster of islands that offers pristine white sandbars and turquoise waters that rival the Maldives. It's not easy to get to, but the journey is worth it for the solitude and unspoiled beauty.</p>
          <h3>Port Barton: The Laid-Back Alternative</h3>
          <p>If El Nido feels too crowded, head to Port Barton. It offers a similar island-hopping experience but with a much more relaxed, village vibe. The coral reefs here are vibrant, and you can often swim with sea turtles just a few meters from the shore.</p>
          <p>Whether you're an adventure seeker or just looking for a quiet spot to read a book, Palawan has a hidden gem waiting for you.</p>

              <li><strong>Isaw</strong>: The undisputed king of Filipino street food. These are barbecued chicken or pig intestines, marinated in a sweet and savory sauce. Don't knock it 'til you try it!</li>

              <li><strong>Taho</strong>: A warm cup of silken tofu, sago pearls, and arnibal (brown sugar syrup). The classic Filipino breakfast on the go.</li>
              <li><strong>Fish Balls</strong>: A staple snack made from pulverized fish meat, deep-fried and poked onto a skewer. The secret is in the sauce—sweet, spicy, or a mix of both.</li>
              <li><strong>Sorbetes</strong>: Also known as "dirty ice cream" (though it's not dirty!), this local ice cream usually comes in flavors like cheese, ube (purple yam), and avocado.</li>

          <p>The most affordable way to reach Vigan is by bus from Manila. The trip takes about 8-10 hours, so an overnight trip is recommended. Several bus lines like Partas and Viron Transit offer comfortable rides.</p>

            <p>Every trip starts the same way for me. A few tabs open, a couple of reels saved, maybe a blog or two bookmarked. On screen, everything looks perfect—clean photos, calm vibes, smiling people. In reality, it often isn’t.</p>
            <p>I’ve stood in places that were supposed to feel magical and instead felt rushed, crowded, and oddly empty. Expensive food. Long queues. The same photo angle repeated a hundred times. What looked unforgettable online turned into something forgettable on the ground. That gap between expectation and experience is what pushed us to think differently about travel decisions.</p>
            <h3>What we look at (and why it matters)</h3>
            <p>The Worth-It Score focuses on things travelers already feel during a trip but don’t usually stop to measure. Instead of popularity or trends, it looks at two core factors: uniqueness and real cost.</p>
            <p><strong>Uniqueness</strong> is about how different the experience actually feels once you’re there. Does the place offer something memorable, or does it feel like many others you’ve already visited? We look at authenticity, local character, and whether the experience feels personal rather than mass-produced for tourists.</p>
            <p><strong>Cost</strong> goes beyond tickets and hotels. It includes expensive food, long waiting times, heavy crowds, and the effort it takes just to enjoy the place. Sometimes the biggest cost isn’t money, but patience. When a destination asks for a lot but gives little back, its value drops quickly.</p>
            <h3>Hidden gems vs tourist traps</h3>
            <p>A hidden gem usually means fewer crowds and more space to explore, fair prices that don’t feel inflated, and experiences that feel genuine and unforced.</p>
            <p>A tourist trap often looks like high prices everywhere simply because it’s popular, crowds that ruin the mood, and great photos but weak memories.</p>
            <p>The Worth-It Score doesn’t tell you where to go. It simply helps you understand what kind of experience you’re walking into before you commit your time and money.</p>

        "content": """
            <p>Starting a trip on a booking app feels like the right thing to do. You open MakeMyTrip, enter your dates, scroll through options, and within minutes it feels like the trip is already taking shape. Flights are compared, hotels are shortlisted, and prices look reasonable. Everything moves fast, and that speed feels reassuring.</p>
            <p>But speed can also hide problems. When booking becomes the first step, the trip is shaped by availability and popularity, not by intent. The platform shows you what’s easy to sell and what most people are choosing. Slowly, without realizing it, your decisions get narrowed down before you’ve even asked what kind of experience you want.</p>
            <h3>Why Booking Platforms Aren't Enough</h3>
            <p>Booking platforms are excellent tools—but they are built for transactions, not exploration. When booking comes before planning, travelers often end up choosing popular destinations because they appear first, well-rated hotels because they feel safe, and standard itineraries because they’re familiar.</p>
            <p>This is how many trips turn into checklists. You move from spot to spot, take photos, stand in lines, and return home feeling like you’ve “done” the destination—but not really experienced it.</p>
            <h3>The Power of Planning</h3>
            <p>Planning works differently because it slows things down. Real planning means understanding the place before committing money. It asks: When is the destination actually enjoyable? What areas are overhyped? Will crowds affect the experience?</p>
            <p>If booking decides your trip, you get something safe and familiar. If planning decides your trip, booking simply helps you bring it to life. And that difference is often what separates a trip you scroll past later from one you remember for years.</p>

            <h3>What social media shows</h3>

            <p>Reality fills in everything the frame cuts out. The long travel time. The waiting. The crowds standing just outside the shot. The noise, the heat, the fatigue.

            <p>Crowds are one of the most common reasons why travel experiences don’t turn out the way people expect. A place can be genuinely beautiful yet still feel tiring if it’s too crowded.

            <h3>Why crowds affect travel</h3>
            <p>Crowds don’t just make places uncomfortable; they change the entire rhythm of a day. When a single stop takes longer than expected, it affects everything that follows. Crowds impact waiting times, energy levels, and the overall pace of the trip.</p>

            <h3>Why hourly timing matters</h3>
